Data on the internet is sometimes presented in PDF's.  But with react and javascriopt you can make a simple spreadsheet more flexible by making it sortable, filterable, and searchable.

The Seattle Department of Transportation puts out a list approved or acceptable street trees, I've converted this list to json data and used in a React table that I've made more flexible.  The original PDF spreadsheet doc is here: [2015 Street Tree List](https://www.seattle.gov/Documents/Departments/SDOT/PublicSpaceManagement/2015-Street_Tree_List.pdf)

Here is a link to my reactjs spreadsheet of the same data from a json file: [Reactjs SDOT Street Tree List](../../sdotstreettrees).
